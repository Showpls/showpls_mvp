## Overview

Showpls is a production-ready Telegram Web App marketplace that connects users with local providers for real-time photos, videos, and live streams from any location worldwide. The platform uses TON blockchain for secure escrow payments and features enterprise-level security, monitoring, and anti-fraud protection.

The application enables users to create location-based requests for visual content with nano-TON precision payments, while providers can fulfill these requests through a secure escrow system. Key features include real-time chat with JWT authentication, comprehensive dispute resolution, automated SLA monitoring, and multi-language support.
